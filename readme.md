Given a search term it will give you the names of the repos on the first results page. This is my first project with python 3.

## Questions
* this project does not contain any information on dependencies. How to spread it?
* What is the proper way to make a configuration file? At the moment this is not commited.
* What is a sensible case convention? PascalCase for classes, snake_case for methods and variables?
