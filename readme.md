# github-selective-scraper

Scrape subsets of github repositories. Warning - this is a work in progress.

## Installation
First, make sure you have anaconda installed. Then
```
git clone git@github.com:ajthinking/github-selective-scraper.git
cd github-selective-scraper
conda env create
conda activate github-selective-scraper
python src/main.py
```

## Todo
- [ ] Move arguments in main.py to (uncommited) settings.py?
- [ ] Fix try-except blocks to throw real errors
